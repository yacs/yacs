# run YACS background process
#
# This configuration file is aiming to run the script cron.php, which is part
# of the YACS distribution archive, at regular time intervals.
#
# The suggested cron line has the following structure:
#
# 09,19,29,39,49,59 * * * * <user> <php> <path/to/yacs/cron.php> >/dev/null 2>&1
#
# where:
#
# - '09,19,29,39,49,59 * * * *' simply asks for one execution every 10 minutes.
#
# - <user> is the account used by the web daemon.
# The default value is www-data, but this can be changed according to actual
# run-time configuration of the web server.
# You should not set this to root, because of security risks.
#
# - <php> is the command to launch the PHP script engine.
# The default value is php, meaning simply that the server has been configured
# properly to have the PHP script engine callable from everywhere.
# You can replace this with the full path to the software,
# for example /usr/bin/php, if necessary.
#
# - <path/to/yacs/cron.php> is the absolute path to the cron.php script.
# The default value is /var/www/yacs/cron.php, but this has to be changed
# according to your actual installation.
#
# - '>/dev/null 2>&1' sends every output to trash
#
# The setup of background processing is not so difficult, providing you pass
# through every following steps:
#
# 1. Finalize the command to use. Open a telnet or putty session to the server,
# and try to launch the cron.php script directly. The outcome of these tests
# are the right values for parameters <php> and <path/to/yacs/cron.php> to
# use in this crontab.
#
# 2. Identify the account used by the web daemon. You can check documentation
# pages of the ISP who is hosting your server or ask the system administrator.
# The ll command will provide you names of user and group assigned to script
# files, and these are probably good starting points as well.
# At the end of the day, you need the parameter <user>.
#
# 3. Activate the crontab. Change this file to reflect proper parameter values,
# and then submit the resulting file to the system administrator
# or ISP for activation. In some cases, you may have to do this yourself.
#
# 4. Stop YACS in-line background processing. Browse the server through the web,
# and visit the system configuration panel. Check the radio button that will
# instruct YACS to rely on external cron.
#
# 5. Check that it works. On tick YACS should fetch news from RSS feeds, or
# received inbound mail messages, as per your settings. Also, you can visit the
# information page on YACS run-time. From the control panel, click on
# the link 'System information', then, on following page, on the 'YACS' link,
# to list recorded times of background processing.
#
# If you edit this file, ensure you save it as a proper Unix thing.
# In particular, pay attention to following elements:
#
# - insert a TAB character around the <user> parameter, not single space
#
# - encode ends of line as single line feeds (which differs from Windows CR+LF)
#
# - add an end of line after the command to execute
