 * [title]What can I do with YACS?[/title]
 *
 * Following patterns should be considered only as examples of what can be achieved with YACS.
 *
 * - Weblogging platform - The powerful templating system of YACS supports various skins,
 * and let web writers focus on what they have to say. Moreover, each weblogger can have one or more weblogs to post in.
 * Actually any YACS section may become a weblog. Of course, an associate may weblog to any section of one site.
 * Also, one or several webloggers can be given editors right to any section.
 * Note that YACS has been built-in features to ping information between servers, and to let surfers comment and
 * discuss any post. Also, posts are automatically archived by weeks and by months.
 *
 * - Original content publishing - Declare managing editors as associates, ask contributing
 * editors to register as regular members. Use the subscription mechanisms to handle the list of
 * readers, and that's it. Note that YACS has built-in features to let managing editors review
 * articles submitted by contributing editors.
 *
 * - Knowledge community - Declare experts as associates, and let interested people register
 * as regular members. Experts will use YACS to structure and to share their knowledge.
 * Each article may be commented by another expert or by any member. Files and links can be attached to
 * any article by any member.
 * Note that YACS has built-in features to encourage people to share with others.
 * For example, each profile lists last contributions of this user.
 *
 * - Passionate members - When several people have a common category of interest, they can decide
 * to setup a YACS server to support their passion, and become associates of this community.
 * Other interested people can register as regular member or as simple e-mail subscribers.
 * Note that YACS has been built-in features to share information between servers, enabling
 * one community to be extended over time.
 *
 * Web masters that are discovering the yacs environment may use following guidelines
 * to reduce the learning curve. We have assumed that you have a quite strong background
 * in php, html, etc.
 *
 * In a ideal world, the three main layers of a good-looking application
 * (i.e., presentation, behaviour, and storage) would be clearly separated.
 * We have tried to support this principle as much as possible with YACS.
 * However, this (good) rule has explicitly been violated where we had to balance with simplicity.
 *
 * [title]The presentation layer[/title]
 *
 * The presentation layer is devoted to php pages. No magic, no complicated
 * template, php has been designed from the outset to do that. Create a subdirectory,
 * put some php files in it, change the main index.php to link it to these files,
 * and that's it.
 *
 * [subtitle]Skins[/subtitle]
 * People that want to make most of their pages look similar will use skins.
 * Once again, there is no magic here. The basic mechanism is to declare
 * a Skin class at the beginning of your file, to assign the page content to some
 * variables, and to include a common php file to deliver the final rendering.
 * To ease the process, we have created two functions. Basically, you only
 * have to call [code]load_skin()[/code] and [code]render_skin()[/code] to do it. Look at the code in
 * the main index.php, this should appear clearly.
 *
 * Do you want to develop your own skin? Fabulous! As a starting point
 * you can copy and rename files from the skins/skeleton directory.
 * Then change the skin name through the configuration panel at control/configure.php and start to tune your
 * new skin until success.
 *
 * See also: [script]skins/index.php[/script]
 *
 * [subtitle]Codes and Smileys[/subtitle]
 * By default text submitted to any yacs server is filtered to protect from hackers.
 * Also, a special set of safe codes are available to beautify your posts.
 *
 * See: [link]codes/index.php[/link] and [link]smileys/index.php[/link]
 *
 * [subtitle]Boxes[/subtitle]
 * What is static and what is dynamic in yacs? Numerous web systems are offering a
 * administration interface to add some boxes on the left or on the right or the main index page.
 * But yacs has no specific administration interface. Boxes are coming from ordinary items
 * of information, articles or whatever.
 *
 * During the setup of the server several sections and categories are created to hold or to flag
 * pages that have to be put in some boxes.
 *
 * By posting articles into following sections you will populate the front page of your server:
 * - 'covers' - the last published article in this section is used as the main cover of your server
 * - 'navigation_boxes' - each article is displayed into its own box on every page of your server
 * - 'extra_boxes' - each article is displayed into its own box, at the site front page only
 * - 'menus' - the last published article in this section is used as the main menu of your server
 *
 * By linking existing articles to following categories you will populate some lists:
 * - i18n:c('featured') - list featured articles
 *
 * See also: [link]sections/index.php[/link], [link]categories/index.php[/link]
 * (you will have to be logged as an associate to view special sections and categories)
 *
 * [subtitle]Blogging[/subtitle]
 * Well, we are quite proud of it: yacs has been fully tested with w.bloggar, and the combination is really fun and handy.
 * Give it a try!
 *
 * See also: [script]services/blog.php[/script], [link]http://wbloggar.com/[/link]
 *
 * [subtitle]Localization[/subtitle]
 * What about localization? In previous developments I used to have a separate
 * file per language to store all strings for this language. While this design
 * has proven to be efficient, it adds a big overhead to the software developer.
 *
 * In yacs, a lightweight mechanism has been selected for localization. When you need
 * a string, declare all variations of this string, but use only one. Take a look
 * at [code]i18n::s()[/code] in [script]shared/global.php[/script] to understand it. The big advantage of this design
 * is that all languages are available at the same time. You may even have some sections
 * of your server in english, and other sections in your native language if you want.
 *
 * See also: [script]shared/global.php[/script]
 *
 * [title]The behaviour layer[/title]
 *
 * As you main know ;-) the behaviour layer of a web server is limited to answering
 * to un-related queries of web components. Therefore, talking about the behaviour
 * of a web server is equivalent to discuss options on submitting requests to the server.
 *
 * [subtitle]Addressing space[/subtitle]
 * Some people have a tendancy to limit the number of scripts, and use complete sets of parameters
 * to build dynamic pages. To handle articles, they will have a single script called
 * articles.php. To create, edit or view an article, they may use something like 'articles.php?op=new',
 * 'articles.php?op=edit&id=12' and 'articles.php?op=view&id=12' respectively.
 *
 * We prefer to create numerous scripts with one or zero parameters.
 * One important reason is that you have to build complete paths to let search engines index your pages
 * extensively. To create, edit or view an article, we are using respectively:
 * 'articles/edit.php', 'articles/edit.php/12', and 'articles/view.php/12'.
 *
 * [subtitle]Module programming interface[/subtitle]
 *
 * Well, apart from common declarations and libraries placed into the shared directory, and of the skin stuff located
 * into the skins directory, there is no special programming interface into yacs.
 *
 * To create you own module, you will to create a new directory and to put callable scripts in it.
 * Of course, it helps to look at existing modules to respect coding standards as much as possible.
 *
 * [subtitle]Overlays[/subtitle]
 * If, during some analysis of your needs, you end up with the conclusion that adding some fields to an
 * article would suffice, then consider overlays as the faster track to deliver.
 *
 * For example, overlays can be used to implement cooking recipes efficiently (i.e., with one single script)
 * while retaining all feature available for articles (e.g., images, files, links, codes, etc.)
 *
 * See: [script]overlays/index.php[/script] for a more complete description of overlays
 *
 * [subtitle]Links and Hooks[/subtitle]
 * Once your scripts are running as expected, you will have to link them with other scripts, and with the site front page.
 * The most simple action is to update the main menu of your site (section 'menus') or to add
 * boxes with adequate information (sections 'navigation_boxes' or 'extra_boxes').
 *
 * You can also use existing hooks to trigger your scripts.
 * This is a very powerful, while straightforward, mechanism, to extend yacs capabilities.
 * For example, the script [script]control/setup.php[/script] has a hook to setup database tables
 * that are not part of the basic set of yacs tables.
 * Likely, the main configuration panel [script]control/index.php[/script] may be extended
 * and reference some of your configuration scripts if necessary.
 *
 * See: [script]control/scan.php[/script] for a more complete description of hooks
 *
 * [title]The storage layer[/title]
 *
 * [subtitle]The database abstraction[/subtitle]
 * Usually, we have separated most of the code related to the database in dedicated php files.
 * This has allowed us to limit the number of scripts interfacing with mySQL.
 *
 * Consider for example lists of articles. They only differ in the amount of information displayed,
 * in the order of rows, and in the number of rows. Moreover, it is very useful to display the same
 * list into several different pages.
 *
 * To make things clearer we have created static classes to support such queries. Do you want a list
 * of the newest articles? Call [code]Articles::list_()[/code] and you will fetch a nice array of labels and related urls.
 *
 * See: [script]articles/articles.php[/script],
 * [script]sections/sections.php[/script], [script]categories/categories.php[/script],
 * [script]files/files.php[/script], [script]links/links.php[/script], [script]comments/comments.php[/script],
 * [script]images/images.php[/script], [script]tables/tables.php[/script],
 * [script]users/users.php[/script]
 *
 * [subtitle]Tables maintenance[/subtitle]
 * The creation and the upgrade of the database schema is made by [script]control/setup.php[/script].
 * This script uses PHP arrays to build adequate mySQL statement.
 * For example, the table storing articles is described in [code]Articles::setup()[/code],
 * in the file [script]articles/articles.php[/script].
 *
 * One innovative feature of yacs is the ability to link items of information on-demand. Therefore,
 * the database schema is simple to handle and to extend, as explained in the next paragrah.
 *
 * [subtitle]Modules and anchors[/subtitle]
 *
 * In yacs a module is simply defined by a set of php files and by a related set of tables in the database.
 * To build a complete page, you will refer to one or several modules by including related php files.
 *
 * That's fine, but how to link modules together? Things are very easy when you are considering independant modules.
 * However, improving the content of your web server usually requires to link the many stored pieces of information.
 * On top of that, you would like to be able to reuse existing modules to link them to new ones with almost no modification.
 *
 * This is where we have introduced anchors. In yacs, anchors are master items that are related to many sub items.
 * Consider for example a section of your site. Hopefully this section will contain several articles. We will say
 * that the section is an anchor. To refer to this anchor, we will use a type (here: 'section') and an id (e.g., '12').
 * Add a colon ':' in the middle, and you will get the full anchor name: 'section:12'.
 *
 * Now that we have an anchor, it is easy to link articles to it. We simply have defined a field named 'anchor' in the article
 * table to store anchor names, and that's it.
 *
 * Six months later. You have created a brand new module named ancestors to handle genealogical data. Of course, you would like
 * to be able to publish articles for each ancestor. How to do that? Well, you will define 'ancestor' as a new type of anchor
 * in your system, and store 'ancestor'-based anchors in the articles table. You don't have to alter the articles table to do it.
 *
 * How to retrieve items related to an anchor? Just ask for it. If you want to list articles in the section 12, select
 * items where anchors = 'section:12'. If you want to list articles related to ancestor 34, select items where
 * anchors = 'ancestor:34'.
 *
 * How to retrieve an anchor related to an item? This is necessary to display a valid context around an item. For example,
 * an article related to a section may mention some introductory words on the section it is in. But an article related
 * to an ancestor may remember the salient dates for this person. Since we don't want to adapt the module that handle articles,
 * we have built a simple interface class named Anchor. This interface, which is the only one used within the articles
 * module, is implemented in derived classes such as Category or Ancestor. Take a look at shared/anchor.php for more information.
 *
 * As a conclusion, if you want to let items behave as anchors for other modules, you will have:
 * <ul><li> to name the type of your anchor (e.g., 'mytype')</li>
 * <li> to implement the Anchor interface in one php file (e.g., 'mytype.php')</li>
 * <li> to update the load_anchor() function in shared/global.php (e.g., on 'mytype:15', prepare the adequate SELECT statement)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The prefix hook is used to invoke any software extension bound as follows:
 * - id: 'help/index.php#prefix'
 * - type: 'include'
 * - parameters: none
 * Use this hook to include any text right before the main content.
 *
 * The suffix hook is used to invoke any software extension bound as follows:
 * - id: 'help/index.php#suffix'
 * - type: 'include'
 * - parameters: none
 * Use this hook to include any text right after the main content.
