/**
 * run one time only scripts
 *
 * This scripts helps to finalize complex software updates, such as:
 * - update of the database schema (e.g., apply complex UPDATE queries to populate new fields of the SQL database)
 * - change files that are not PHP scripts (e.g., change cascading style sheets of reference skins)
 * - download of binary files (e.g., get a copy of the Flash viewer for Freemind maps)
 *
 * [title]How to write a script to be ran once?[/title]
 *
 * Such script is really simple to write, since the only requirement for software developer is to
 * display information to the surfer through 'echo' commands. This is because the regular page factory
 * (updated via the $context variable) is not available during the execution of multiple scripts.
 *
 * Except for the bare display interface, a script that is ran once benefits from the full power of YACS (database access, localization, ...).
 *
 * Exemple of a script to perform some database update:
 * [php]
 * <?php
 * // feed-back
 * echo 'Change anchors in files...<br />'."\n";
 *
 * // split membership components
 * $query = "UPDATE ".SQL::table_name('files')
 *			." SET anchor_type = SUBSTRING_INDEX(anchor, ':', 1)"
 *			.", anchor_id = SUBSTRING_INDEX(anchor, ':', -1)";
 * if($count = SQL::query($query, TRUE))
 *	echo $count.' records have been updated.<br />'."\n";
 *
 * ?>
 * [/php]
 *
 * [title]How to run scripts only once?[/title]
 *
 * All you have to do it to upload these scripts into the directory [code]scripts/run_once[/code], and to launch
 * the [code]scripts/run_once.php[/code] script.
 *
 * The script will locate every script into [code]scripts/run_once[/code] and include each of them.
 * Also, to avoid further execution, each executed script is renamed by appending the extension '.done'.
 *
 * [title]How to run scripts during software updates?[/title]
 *
 * If some reference scripts are put into the [code]scripts/run_once[/code] directory, they will be transferred
 * and installed at the target server as other scripts.
 *
 * For example, if you have to change the database through some software upgrade, and if this update has to
 * be performed only once, you will:
 * - prepare the software upgrade as usual, assuming that scripts may use an updated database
 * - prepare an additional script to change the database itself, for example: [code]my_database_update.php[/code]
 * - put this additional script into [code]scripts/run_once[/script]
 *
 * During the software upgrade, [script]scripts/update.php[/script] will transfer every new script,
 * including [code]my_database_update.php[/code], to the staging repository.
 * Also, [script]control/scan.php[/script] and [script]control/setup.php[/script] are launched as usual
 * to ensure that the database schema is correct. Then [script]scripts/run_once.php[/script] will launch
 * [code]my_database_update.php[/code], to actually finalize the database change.
 *
 * Note that if there is no script to run in [code]scripts/run_once.php[/code], and if we are in the middle
 * of an update (because [code]parameters/switch.off[/code] exists), then the surfer is silently redirected to [script]control/index.php[/script].
 *
 * While the run-once approach is powerful and should suffice for most needs, you may have to complement it
 * in very specific cases. People interested into weird software will take a look at [script]scripts/update_trailer.php[/script].
 *
 * [title]What happens on first installation?[/title]
 *
 * The YACS archive that contains reference scripts is used jointly on first installation and on upgrades.
 * However, scripts to be ran once are useful only for upgrades.
 * Therefore, on first installation (i.e., when the switch file is absent), the extension '.done' is appended to
 * every script in the directory scripts/run_once without actual execution of them.
